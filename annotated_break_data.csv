Then have some sort of loose federal structure, monetary policy, diplomatic services, national defense. It might well be the beginnings of a more stable Iraq. Certainly the one we now look at. STEWART: And as we look at how unstable Iraq is with the election just six days away. Is the U.S. military prepared to handle this? What does it mean militarily if the election does not go out-- does not go well, it turns out to be a violent day? MCCAFFREY: Im sure the election will be a violent day. There will be a very low turnout. Probably in the contested parts of the country, which include Baghdad. Maybe 40 percent, 50 percent of the population. There will be a lot of trouble. The election, nonetheless, is an important weigh station en route to some form of legitimate regime. So I think we ought to be very optimistic that a year from now, if we continue on the present path, U.S. armed forces are not Theyll deal with it. A year from now, we ought to be better for sure than we are today. STEWART: As you know, and everybody heard when I read some of those statements, from Zarqawi, he released this message. A call to insurgents that really uses this hearts and minds argument that we all talk about. Do nt let this election happen. Do nt believe this big American lie of democracy. Do nt let it sway you. How do we counter the hearts and mind argument with six days left to the election? MCCAFFREY: I think youll see very widespread support for the notion of elections. Certainly from the Shia majority. The underclass of Iraqi society had been terrorized for 40 years by Saddam and his thugs. They welcome this. And so do the Kurds in the north, the other 20 percent of the population. So weve got a struggle, a civil war going on for the Sunni to regain control of a country that they dominated and terrorized for a lot of years. We should expect it. Well to have deal political will and the courage to stay with this, will be better for the region and for the Iraqis. STEWART: General Barry McCaffrey, MSNBC military analyst. We thank you so much for taking the time tonight. MCCAFFREY: Good to be with you. STEWART: Two major papers have run with this story. The Pentagon is responding, sort of. Here the gist. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld does nt think the United States has enough spies or at least not enough under his control. The"" Washington Post"" was the first to report that Rumsfeld has created a new spy unit at the Defense Department and has its own interpretation of U.S. law on espionage operations. All in an effort to end his dependence on the CIA. This so-called strategic support branch has been operating secretly for two years in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other undisclosed locations. A spokesman said that the Defense Department did not break or even bend any laws. Senator John McCain wants the armed services committee to look into that but the committees chair tonight is supporting the program. Senator John Department officials today. Warner calls the program vital. And will offer full briefings on the matter to senators on the committee. The battle between man and beast. Or rather man and bird.
